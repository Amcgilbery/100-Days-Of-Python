100 Days of Python Coding Challenge


I have some experience with Python, mostly string manipulation, creating lists, dicts, tuples. Iterating over dicts, lists, and tuples. 
This is a showcase of the projects I'm learning through a "100 Days of Coding" Challenge. I'm attempting to futher my knowledge and increase what I can do with Python.
